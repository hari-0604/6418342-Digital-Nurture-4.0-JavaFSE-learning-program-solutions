## Sorting Algorithms Overview

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity (Avg) | Space | Notes |
|----------------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| Bubble Sort    | O(nÂ²)                 | O(1)   | Simple, but inefficient for large data |
| Quick Sort     | O(n log n)            | O(log n)| Fast and preferred for most real-world cases |
