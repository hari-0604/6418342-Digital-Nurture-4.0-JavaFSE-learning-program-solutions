# Task Management System - Singly Linked List

## Objective

Implement a dynamic task management system using a singly linked list in Java.

---

##  What is a Singly Linked List?

A data structure where each node points to the next, allowing dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions.

## Features

- Add a task
- Search a task by ID
- Delete a task
- Traverse and display tasks

## Time Complexity

| Operation     | Time Complexity |
|---------------|------------------|
| Add Task      | O(n)             |
| Search Task   | O(n)             |
| Delete Task   | O(n)             |
| Traverse      | O(n)             |
