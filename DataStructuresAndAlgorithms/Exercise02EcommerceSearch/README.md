# E-commerce Product Search

## Objective

Implement and compare linear and binary search algorithms for product search on an e-commerce platform.

---

## Why Big O Notation?

Big O helps analyze how search time scales:
- **Best Case (Ω):** Item is at the start.
- **Average Case (Θ):** Item is somewhere in the middle.
- **Worst Case (O):** Item is at the end or not present.

## Data Structures Used

- `Product[]` (array) to store products
- Linear search: simple iteration
- Binary search: requires sorted array

---

## Features

- Search product by name using:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

## Time Complexity

| Algorithm     | Best | Average | Worst |
|---------------|------|---------|--------|
| Linear Search | O(1) | O(n)    | O(n)   |
| Binary Search | O(1) | O(log n)| O(log n)|
