##  Exercises Included

### Exercise 1: Inventory Management System
- **Concepts:** HashMap, CRUD operations
- **Scenario:** Managing warehouse inventory using `productId` as key
- **Data Structure Used:** `HashMap<Integer, Product>`
- **Operations:** Add, Update, Delete, Display
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for Add, Update, Delete

###  Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function
- **Concepts:** Linear Search, Binary Search
- **Scenario:** Product search by name or ID
- **Search Algorithms:** Implemented both Linear and Binary Search
- **Comparison:** Binary search is faster for sorted data

###  Exercise 3: Sorting Customer Orders
- **Concepts:** Bubble Sort, Quick Sort
- **Scenario:** Sort orders by `totalPrice` to prioritize
- **Analysis:** Quick Sort preferred for large datasets due to O(n log n) complexity

### Exercise 4: Employee Management System
- **Concepts:** Arrays
- **Scenario:** CRUD operations on employee records
- **Limitations:** Fixed size, expensive deletions

### Exercise 5: Task Management System
- **Concepts:** Singly Linked List
- **Scenario:** Managing dynamic task entries
- **Advantage:** Efficient for insertion/deletion

### Exercise 6: Library Management System
- **Concepts:** Search algorithms
- **Scenario:** Book lookup by title
- **Used:** Linear Search (unsorted), Binary Search (sorted)

### Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting
- **Concepts:** Recursion, Time Complexity
- **Scenario:** Predicting future values with compounding growth
- **Optimization:** Memoization to reduce stack usage
