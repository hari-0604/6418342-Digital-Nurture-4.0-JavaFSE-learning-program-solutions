# Java FSE Digital Nurture 4.0 – Design Principles & Patterns

This repository contains Java implementations of key **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** and **Design Principles** 

These patterns and principles are crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and flexible software applications.

## What’s Covered

This folder includes implementation of the following:

### Creational Design Patterns
| Pattern Name   | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Singleton**  | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. |
| **Factory Method** | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. |
| **Builder**    | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. |

---

### Structural Design Patterns
| Pattern Name   | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Adapter**    | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. |
| **Decorator**  | Adds responsibilities to an object dynamically without modifying its structure. |
| **Proxy**      | Controls access to another object, adding an extra layer like security, logging, or lazy loading. |

---

### Behavioral Design Patterns
| Pattern Name   | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Observer**   | Establishes a one-to-many relationship so that when one object changes state, its dependents are notified. |
| **Strategy**   | Enables selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime. |
| **Command**    | Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize methods with different requests. |

---

### Architectural Pattern
| Pattern Name   | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** | Separates application logic, UI, and control logic for scalable UI applications. |

---

### Dependency Management
| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Dependency Injection** | Promotes loose coupling by injecting dependencies at runtime rather than creating them directly in classes. |
