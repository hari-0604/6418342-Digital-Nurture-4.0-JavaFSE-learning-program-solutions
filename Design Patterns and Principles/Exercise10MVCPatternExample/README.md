## Overview
This Java project demonstrates the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern** using a student record management system.

**MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components:

Model: Manages the data and business logic.

View: Handles the presentation and user interface.

Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing input and updating both.



## Components

- `Student.java`: The **Model** holding student data.
- `StudentView.java`: The **View** to display student info.
- `StudentController.java`: The **Controller** that manages interaction between model and view.
- `Main.java`: Demonstrates updating and displaying student info.
