# SingletonPatternExample


This project demonstrates the Singleton Design Pattern in Java using a `Logger` utility class.

->The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance throughout the application and provides a global point of access to that instance.

It is commonly used when:

*Only one object is needed to coordinate actions (e.g., Logger, Configuration, Cache).

*You want to control access to a shared resource.

## Files used
- `Logger.java`: Singleton implementation of the Logger.
- `Main.java`: Test class to verify only one Logger instance is created.

## To Run the Project
1. Compile: `javac *.java`
2. Run: `java Main`
